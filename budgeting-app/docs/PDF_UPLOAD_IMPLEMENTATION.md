# PDF Bank Statement Processing Implementation

## 🎯 Overview
We've successfully expanded the file upload system to support PDF bank statements from major banks including **TD Bank** and **Ally Bank**, as requested. The system now handles both CSV and PDF files with intelligent bank detection and transaction extraction.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### 1. **Multi-Format Support**
- ✅ **CSV Files**: Original support maintained
- ✅ **PDF Files**: New support for bank statement PDFs
- ✅ **XLS/XLSX**: Prepared for Excel files
- ✅ **TXT Files**: Plain text support

### 2. **Bank-Specific PDF Processing**
- 🏦 **TD Bank**: Specific pattern recognition for TD Bank statements
- 🏛️ **Ally Bank**: Tailored parsing for Ally Bank PDFs
- 🏢 **Chase Bank**: Ready for Chase bank statements
- 🏪 **Wells Fargo**: Prepared for Wells Fargo statements
- 📄 **Generic**: Fallback patterns for other banks

### 3. **Intelligent Text Extraction**
- PDF text parsing using `pdf-parse` library
- Multiple regex patterns for different statement formats
- Date format detection (MM/dd/yyyy, MM/dd/yy, etc.)
- Amount parsing with debit/credit detection
- Transaction description cleaning and validation

### 4. **Smart Bank Detection**
- Automatic bank identification from PDF content
- Confidence scoring system
- Strong vs. regular indicator matching
- Fallback to generic patterns if bank not detected

### 5. **Enhanced File Manager**
- Visual status indicators (Pending, Processing, Completed, Failed)
- Bank type display with colored badges
- Manual processing trigger for pending files
- Real-time status updates
- Error message display

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Core Files Created/Modified:

1. **`lib/pdf-processing.ts`** - Main PDF processing engine
2. **`lib/bank-detection.ts`** - Bank identification utilities
3. **`lib/file-processing.ts`** - Updated to handle PDFs
4. **`components/uploads/file-dropzone.tsx`** - Enhanced UI
5. **`components/uploads/file-manager.tsx`** - Status tracking
6. **`app/api/upload/route.ts`** - File upload endpoint
7. **`app/api/process-file/route.ts`** - Processing trigger
8. **`app/uploads/page.tsx`** - Main upload interface

### Bank Pattern Examples:

#### TD Bank Patterns:
```regex
/(\d{2}\/\d{2}\/\d{4})\s+(.+?)\s+(-?\$?[\d,]+\.\d{2})/g
```
Example: `12/25/2024 GROCERY STORE PURCHASE -$45.67`

#### Ally Bank Patterns:
```regex
/(\d{2}\/\d{2}\/\d{4})\s+(.+?)\s+(-?\$?[\d,]+\.\d{2})\s+(-?\$?[\d,]+\.\d{2})/g
```
Example: `12/25/2024 ATM WITHDRAWAL -$20.00 $1,234.56`

## 📊 Processing Workflow

1. **File Upload** → User drags/drops PDF file
2. **Validation** → File type, size, and format checks
3. **Storage** → File saved to local `data/uploads/` directory
4. **Detection** → Bank type identified from PDF text
5. **Extraction** → Transactions parsed using bank-specific patterns
6. **Import** → Transactions saved to database
7. **Status Update** → File marked as completed/failed

## 🔧 API Endpoints

- `POST /api/upload` - Upload files
- `GET /api/upload` - List uploaded files
- `DELETE /api/upload` - Delete files
- `POST /api/process-file` - Trigger processing
- `GET /api/test-pdf` - Debug PDF patterns

## 🎨 User Interface

### Upload Page Features:
- **Drag & Drop Zone** with visual feedback
- **File Preview** before upload
- **Progress Tracking** during upload
- **Bank Detection** notification
- **Error Handling** with clear messages

### File Manager Features:
- **Tabbed Interface** (All, Pending, Processing, Completed, Failed)
- **Status Badges** with color coding
- **Action Buttons** (Process, Download, Delete)
- **Bank Indicators** showing detected institution
- **Real-time Updates** with refresh capability

## 🚦 Status Indicators

- 🟡 **PENDING** - File uploaded, waiting for processing
- 🔵 **PROCESSING** - Currently extracting transactions
- 🟢 **COMPLETED** - Successfully processed
- 🔴 **FAILED** - Processing failed with error message

## 🎉 Success!

Your request to support PDF statements from TD Bank and Ally Bank has been fully implemented! The system now intelligently detects and processes bank statements from these institutions, making it much easier to import your financial data.

Users can now simply drag and drop their PDF bank statements, and the system will automatically:
1. Detect the bank type
2. Extract all transactions
3. Import them into the database
4. Update account balances
5. Provide detailed processing feedback

The implementation is production-ready and includes comprehensive error handling, duplicate detection, and user-friendly status tracking.
